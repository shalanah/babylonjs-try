# BabylonJS Code Challenge

## Challenge 

Using BabylonJS and VanillaJS (no jquery, bootstrap, or ui libraries), create a scene with a sphere and 3 boxes, one red, one green, and one blue. The UI should have 3 buttons. One of the buttons should make the sphere move at a constant speed from its current position (like a projectile) to the red box, one should make it move to the green box, and one should make it move to the blue box. Once the sphere hits the box, it should stop moving, and the box should change colors to white. While the sphere is in motion, all UI should be disabled.
